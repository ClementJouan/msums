2015-03-04: This is just a test to see if I can push the repo on Huluvu
even if the group has no writing rights.

So? works!

Now one more test:
just:

git push

instead of
git push origin master
==> OK didn't work, had to use:
git push --set-upstream origin master

Now check again it that works by just:
git push
